# Foodly
This is my first project for the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. 
I have always wanted to do this Project, and now with this challenge i take the opportunity to do it and also take the time to improve my coding. 
This app will help me keep track of expiring food by signaling possible mixing recipes i can obtain using the food closest to expiry.
